# Papyrus
This project implement the Longest common sub-sequence algorithm in the article "Document reconstruction using dynamic programming".

Follow the example in section "2.3 Matching" of the article, they compare two sequences: 
X = {0223110133} 
Y = {0223101133} 
And the result of "longest common sub-sequence" is {02231}.

You can test by following commands:

=> Run the project: ./Papyrus

=> Edit two sequences in "main.cpp" (vectorX and vectorY)

=> Compile the project: make
